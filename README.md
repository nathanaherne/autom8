# AutoM8 README FILE

# Overview

I created Autom8 because I wanted to have an awesome garden automation system. I had a number of things I wanted to provide power to or turn on/off at set times during the day. I started with Arduino but realised that it would be easier to use a Raspberry Pi as it would give me the option to add more advanced features later.

I started this project with a single 8 pin relay (the cheap ebay ones) hooked up to a Raspberry Pi Model B+ (version 1).

This is my first time writing in Python for a decade or so, the code isn't going to be pretty.

To change the on/off times for each relay you use the userVars.py file.
